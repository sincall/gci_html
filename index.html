   Congratulations, you have completed "no-of-task-completed" task. Google Code-In hopes to 
  introduce teenagers, like you, to the world of open source development. With a wide variety of 
  bite-sized tasks, we hope that you learnt something valuable from this experience. We hope to see 
    you participate next year.
